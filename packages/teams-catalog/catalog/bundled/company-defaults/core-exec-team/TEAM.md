# Core Exec Team

The Core Exec Team is the bundled default install for a new Taskcore company. It boots the smallest org that can take a board prompt, plan it, implement it, and verify it.

## Contents

- `CEO` — strategy, prioritization, delegation. Uses `task-planning` and `issue-triage` to keep the inbox moving.
- `CTO` — technical execution and engineering oversight. Reports to CEO. Uses `github-pr-workflow` for code review and merge hygiene.
- `QA` — verifies fixes and captures evidence. Reports to CTO. Uses `qa-acceptance` for structured acceptance reports.
- `first-project` — starter project under the CTO for converting the company goal into the first implementation task.
- `first-heartbeat` — recurring CEO heartbeat to review priorities and confirm the next useful task.

## Migration notes

This entry mirrors the historical `server/src/onboarding-assets/ceo/` template family while staying inside the catalog package boundary. Each agent has a short role description in `AGENTS.md`. Runtime procedures come from the harness, repository instructions, and installed skills. Legacy persona files are not part of catalog imports.
